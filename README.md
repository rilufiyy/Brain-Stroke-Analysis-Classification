# Brain-Stroke-Analysis-Classification
This project analyzes and predicts brain stroke risk using Random Forest, SVM, and a Simple ANN. It includes data preprocessing, outlier detection, and feature encoding. Models are compared using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to identify the most effective stroke prediction approach.
